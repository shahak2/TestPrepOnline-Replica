                    <p>The Cognitive Abilities Test (CogAT) consists of three batteries: verbal battery, non-verbal battery, and quantitative battery. Each battery contains three sub-tests. 

We have developed different practice packs of the CogAT for different grades. Make sure to check with your school which test your child should be taking. 

You can also take a look at our pages offering more detailed information about the batteries, sample questions, scoring methods, and more. It is important to have all the details about the test before you take it to avoid unnecessary surprises (for example, having less time than planned to solve each question).

The CogAT also has a different form called the CogAT Screening Form. This new test consists of the first sub-test in each battery.

Make sure to check our sample questions for the CogAT. The idea behind the sample questions is to be familiar with the format of the test, the difficulty, and the questions themselves. Sample questions are always good to make a preliminary assessment of your skills. If there is a type of question that you recognize as particularly problematic, then perhaps you should focus your efforts into getting used to that type of question. Conversely, for questions that you can solve more easily, perhaps you will find that the time saved in those questions is good enough to have extra practice, or to overall create a good preparation environment.</p>
                    <h2 id="SampleQuestions">Free Cogat Sample Questions</h2>
                    <p> These free samples will allow you to get a feel for the types of questions that appear on the CogAT. Each sample test is followed by answers and detailed explanations for each question.

When buying our practice packs, you get study guides to refresh some of the most challenging topics, a full-length simulation, and you can even get a section with challenging questions for extra practice or an enrichment section. Make sure you go through all the questions before the test. Also, we advise you start practicing with ample time so that you are not pressured and can dedicate the right amount of time to each question.

Ideally, you should take two weeks to prepare for a test having already gathered the information. The study strategy is already something more personal. Some people prefer studying in the morning, first reviewing all the material, and only then going through the questions. Other people prefer trying to solve each question first, reading the explanation if they do not succeed, and if they are stuck, resort to a study guide if the topic is not fresh enough.</p>

"I took test prep online subscription for my son's GT testing. The questions on CogAT helped him very much as they are of the same format as what he got at test also. Besides he loves to do that, they are kids friendly and its a lot of fun for them. Although they don't have any customer care line, but their customer support via email is very quick and they always resolved the issue in an hour only. I'm grateful that i took the subscription and i believe that its because of testprep-online that my son is now in GT classes."</div>
